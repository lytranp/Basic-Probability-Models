This file includes 2 main parts

- Part 1: Plot basic graphs
  + Histogram
  + Box-and-whisker plot
  + Bee swarm 
  + Scatter plot
  + One of the most useful graph: Empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF)

- Part 2: Basic probability models
  + Probability function for discrete variables
    + Bernoulli trials
    + Binomial distribution
    + Poisson distribution
  + Probability function for continuous variables: Probability density functions with special case: Normal Distribution
